# Microwave-Oven-Simulator
This is an embedded software project on a Microwave oven which was simulated using the PICSIMLAB software on the PIC Genios board.

This project was implemented using the 8-bit PIC microcontroller "PIC16F877A".

MPLAB X IDE  was used in writing the code for the operations performed in the microwave oven.

It contains four modes of operations :
1. MICRO MODE 
2. GRILL MODE
3. CONVECTION MODE
4. START MODE.
